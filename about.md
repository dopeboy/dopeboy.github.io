## Bio

Software engineer based out of <s>NYC</s> the bay area. Used to work [here](http://ms.com) and [here](http://whitehouse.gov). Also launched a startup that [didn't work out](http://dopeboy.github.io/Lessons/). 

I like coding and teaching and sometimes [both at the same time](https://codenation.org/).

I run a [small consulting shop](https://www.thenorthstarlabs.com) where we write code and occasionally train others on how to write code.
