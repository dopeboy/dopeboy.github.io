## Bio

I'm an engineer who likes building software. I've had to opportunity to ship software in government, on wall street, and now in Silicon Valley. The greatest joy I get is seeing my work impact people's lives - whether it's saving them time, saving them money, or providing a moment of fun.

## What I value

* Speed. More often than not, doing things quickly is more important than doing things right. Both have their place, but the former approach optimizes for pace of learning, which in startups, is the most important thing. More about that [here](https://dopeboy.github.io/speed/).

* Integrity. Word spreads fast, reputations even faster. Do what you say and say what you do.

* Persistence. When you get beat down, pick yourself and keep trying. You lose (and sometimes you have to) when you take yourself out of the game.

## What I do for work

I'm currently exploring building a startup in the AI agents space, targeted towards Solutions Consultants. Drop me a line if you are too! 

Before that, I was the co-founder and CEO of Swoops, a fantasy sports basketball game with the twist that you could own the players. Prior to that, I was an early engineer at Disco. And prior to that, I worked in Morgan Stanley and in the Obama White House.

## What I do for fun

* I like riding my ~~motorcycle~~ Surron ebike. I haven't owned a car since 2008.

* I like [scuba diving](http://dopeboy.github.io/liveaboard/).

* I like making [Neapolitan pizza](http://dopeboy.github.io/roccbox-pizza/).

* I was a four year classroom volunteer for [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/).

## Fun facts

* I had a motorcycle [accident](https://x.com/manishsinhaha/status/1694162032831205622) in 2023 and the paramedics gave me Fentanyl. Fortunately and unfortunately, it works pretty well.

* I've participated and/or mentored in over 15 hackathons, including the first ever hackathon in the Gaza strip.

* I went to Egypt during the revoluton in 2011, for fun. [Here's a photo](https://photos.app.goo.gl/zEURWZaeWx96k1nM8) of me near Tahrir Square in front a tank.
