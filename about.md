## Bio

I like building things using software and hardware. I like dreaming big and I like being around big dreamers. There are few things that get me as excited as an idea, an empty whiteboard, and a fresh text editor. 

## What I do for work

* I run a [small consultancy](https://www.thenorthstarlabs.com) where we write code for companies and occasionally train others on how to write code.

* I'm a contributor to [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django), an open source library for Django. 

* I'm the president of the San Francisco chapter of the [Columbia Venture Community](https://www.columbiaventurecommunity.com/) where I lead a twelve person board and do event programming around entrepreneurship for Columbia alums.

* I'm currently focused on a stealth venture in the hardware space involving robotics.

## What I do for fun

* I'm part of the [Oakland chapter](openoakland.org) of Code For America where I'm the co-founder of [Lane Lookout](https://www.lanelookout.org/), a free non-profit web app to help Oakland cyclists report bike lane violations.

* I like [scuba diving](http://dopeboy.github.io/liveaboard/).

* I like making [Neapolitan pizza](http://dopeboy.github.io/roccbox-pizza/).

* I'm a four year classroom volunteer for [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/).

## Fun facts

* I've participated and/or mentored in over 15 hackathons, including the first ever hackathon in the Gaza strip.

* I went to Egypt during the revoluton in 2011 (for fun!)

* I used to work at the White House and once [met and talked to](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5UXiQO2EAQaMHdsQlV4el9VOGIwNWpRY01GY205U3NIUnRR/view?usp=sharing) President Obama in the Oval Office.
