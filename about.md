## Bio

I like building things using software and hardware. I like dreaming big and I like being around big dreamers. There are few things that get me as excited as an idea, an empty whiteboard, and a fresh text editor. 

## What I do

I run a [small consultancy](https://www.thenorthstarlabs.com) where we write code and occasionally train others on how to write code. I'm currently focused on a stealth venture in the hardware space involving robotics.

## Fun facts

* I've participated and/or mentored in over 15 hackathons. 
* I scuba dive.
* My favorite food is neapolitan pizza.
