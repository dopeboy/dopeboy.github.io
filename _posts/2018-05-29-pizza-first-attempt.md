title: Results from my first attempt at making Neopolitan Pizza

Based off of Kenji's [Hacker Free Neopolitan Pizza](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/hacker-free-neapolitan-pizza-for-a-home-kitchen-recipe.html) recipe

Couple thoughts:

* This is the closest to neopolitan I've gotten. Thin crust, leopard pattern on the top and bottom. 
* It wasn't as chewy as I wanted it to be (the test I use is whether it folds rather than bends when pinched by hand end to end - it'd mostly fold but not as sharply as an american slice).
* I wanted the cheese to burn a little more but that'd mean the crust would overcook. Not quite sure what the solution is here.
* There's a step in the recipe where you leave the dough out to rise. Mine did not rise. Reasons? I think too much hydration + the oil in the bowl sank from the sides to the bottom and engulfed the dough.

Overall, good progress. Took a lot of time (3 days of waiting, ~2.5 hours of labor) but worth it. Couple things to try on the next iteration:

* Kenji recommends a scale for accuracy purposes - might be time to get one to make sure my mix is right.
* I got rise when cooking but it was moderate. I need to find the reason why I'm not getting good, high rise.
* I forgot to take a photo of the cross section for analysis. Will do that next time.
* The flour on the pan to prevent sticking would start burning over time - need to dust it out from pizza to pizza.
* When kneading the dough, I'd mess up and tear it and start from scratch which I imagine hurts something. I want to work on getting this right.
