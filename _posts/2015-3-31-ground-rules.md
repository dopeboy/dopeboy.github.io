title: Ground rules
---

I've become comfortable enough with writing to lay down some self-imposed rules:

1. I write for myself, not you. I'm not doing this to get clicks. I'm not doing this to build my "online brand". I'm doing this to bring clarity to my own thoughts.To that end, I have and intend to keep analytics off this blog. I will never know how many people read this.

2. I'm not going to repost content from elsewhere. I'm going to assume you've already solved your online content discovery problem.

3. Quality over quantity. I know there's a movement out there to "commit often"---it's not for me. I'm only going to write when I have something to say.

4. The majority of my posts will be about engineering (hardware & software), entrepreneurship, and teaching. There will be infrequent posts about music, travel, media, and psychology. 

5. I will not write about politics, religion, or any other "controversial" deemed topic. This is unfortunate and sad.
