title: Neapolitan pizza in a Roccbox
---

To cook good Neapolitan pizza, you need high heat (900F+). A conventional oven won't provide that so you need a specialized oven. After some research, I came across [Kenji's fantastic piece comparing multiple pizza ovens](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/05/best-backyard-pizza-ovens-review.html) and ended up buying a [Roccbox](https://www.roccbox.com/us/product/).

## Ordering it

I bought the Roccbox online for $599. They ship out of Virginia so if you're on the west coast like me, expect a shipping time of a week. After I had ordered it, I didn't get a confirmation for a couple days and had to ask over email for a tracking number. My guess is they're still figuring things out as a startup. It wasn't a big deal, just something to be aware of.

## Package and assembly

It's heavy. Their claim on it being portable is a little bit of a stretch. "Semi portable" is probably more like it. Packaging, etc is on point. Setting it up is a breeze. There's nothing really to do but stretch out the leg stands and connect the burner. I use the gas burner, not the wood.

## Cooking

I followed [Kenji's recipe for Neapolitan dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/07/basic-neapolitan-pizza-dough-recipe.html#comments-32611) using King Arthur's bread flour instead of 00 Caputo. Couple observations & lessons:

* Turn the flame up all the way during preheat but then turn it down before putting in your pizza to prevent burnage.

* Initially, I exposed each fourth of the pizza to the flame once and then took it out. This resulted in excessive burning. Exposing each quadrant to the flame for a shorter duration multiple times (~2, maybe 3) seems like the way to go. It's more of an even cook.

* Dust the peel so that the dough doesn't stick to it when you try to slide it off into the oven.
