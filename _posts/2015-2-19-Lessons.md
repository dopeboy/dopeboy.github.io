title: Two years

Two years ago to this day I quit my job.

I quit for a lot of reasons but mostly to strike it out on my own and build a business. That part didn't work out as planned; I ended up closing shop about a year later. This post is about some of the lessons I learned along the way.

## Background

I set out to build a peer-to-peer marketplace called Qhojo (pronounced ko-jo; I know, bad sign already). On Qhojo, videographers, photographers and other creators could lend and borrow equipment from and to other. Think AirBnB for camera and video gear. It took three months to build the first iteration and another three to build the second iteration.By the time I shut it down, it had about 250 signed up users and had facilitated a handful of transactions.12

## Lessons

1. **Pick a name that can be spelled easily**: I can't tell you how many times people asked me "is that with a 'c' or 'k'"? It was a name that was incredibly difficult to spell and more critically, impossible to reproduce after hearing. This made it tough for the casual meetup attendee or passer-by to look us up at home. *For those curious, the name was inspired by the word hindi "Khojo" which means "find it".*
2. **Get the risk-to-reward ratio right**: The average item price on Qhojo was around $2000. Typically, rental rates for A/V equipment are about 1% of their total price so ~$20 a day in our case.  Suppose an average rental span of 3 days.<br/><br/>The equipment owner has to post an item, accept a request for someone to borrow that item, establish meetup logistics for the exchange, establish meetup logistics again for the return, meet the person for the return, and then verify the equipment still works. Is it worth the owner's time to perform all these tasks for $60? More importantly, are those $60 a sufficient reward for the risk of damage, internal or otherwise, of their possessions?
