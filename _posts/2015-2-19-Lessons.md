title: Two years

Two years ago to this day I quit my job.

I quit for a lot of reasons but mostly to strike it out on my own and build a business. That part didn't work out as planned; I ended up closing shop about a year later. This post is about some of the mistakes I made along the way.

## Background

I set out to build a peer-to-peer marketplace called Qhojo (pronounced ko-jo; I know, bad sign already). On Qhojo, videographers, photographers and other creators could lend and borrow equipment from and to other. Think AirBnB for camera and video gear. It took three months to build the first iteration and another three to build the second iteration.By the time I shut it down, it had about 250 signed up users and had facilitated a handful of transactions.12

## Lessons

1. **Bad name**: I can't tell you how many times people asked me "is that with a 'c' or 'k'"? It was a name that was incredibly difficult to spell and more critically, impossible to reproduce after hearing. This made it tough for the casual meetup attendee or passer-by to look us up at home. *For those curious, the name was inspired by the hindi word "Khojo" which means "find it".*
<br/><br/>
2. **High risk-to-reward ratio**: The average item price on Qhojo was around $2000. Typically, rental rates for A/V equipment are about 1% of their total price so ~$20 a day in our case.  Suppose an average rental span of 3 days. Suppose a comission of 10%.<br/><br/>The equipment owner has to post an item, accept a request for someone to borrow that item, establish meetup logistics for the exchange, establish meetup logistics again for the return, meet the person for the return, and then verify that the equipment still works. <br/><br/>Is it worth the owner's time to perform all these tasks for ($20*3)-($20*3*.1) = $54? More importantly, is the $54 a sufficient reward for the risk of damage, internal or otherwise, of their possession? I didn't think so.
<br/><br/>
3. **Over development**: I focused on making the cleanest, meanest, and leanest machine out there. I automated where I could and made a moderate effort at producing maintainable code through periodic refactoring. <br/><br/>This was a waste of time.<br/><br/> I should have built the absolute minimum and then manually maintained transactions through the backend if need be. To hell with formality. I was in the business of proving a hypothesis yet I acted as if it was already proved.<br/><br/>There's a broader post here but this has to do with the formal training I had during schooling and professional work. In school, engineers are taught to build efficient and elegant solutions. In a professional work setting, code reviews check for each. Interestingly, I don't see self-taught / non-formally taught developers make this mistake.
