title: Two years

Two years ago to this day I quit my job.

I quit for a lot of reasons but mostly to strike it out on my own and build a business. That part didn't work out as planned; I ended up closing shop about a year later. This post is about some of the lessons I learned along the way.

## Background

I set out to build a peer-to-peer marketplace called Qhojo (pronounced ko-jo; I know, bad sign already). On Qhojo, videographers, photographers and other creators could lend and borrow equipment from and to other. Think AirBnB for camera and video gear. It took three months to build the first iteration and another three to build the second iteration.By the time I shut it down, it had about 250 signed up users and had facilitated a handful of transactions.
